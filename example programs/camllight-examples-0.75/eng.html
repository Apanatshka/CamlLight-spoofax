<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="JoeCaml.gif" ALT=""> Caml Light program examples</H1>

<P>This directory contains some examples of Caml Light programs.

<P>The examples can either be compiled and executed as standalone
programs (just type <CODE>make</CODE> in the subdirectory), or run
interactively under <CODE>camllight</CODE> (the graphics programs must
be run under <CODE>camllight camlgraph</CODE>), by executing

<PRE>
               include "loadall";;
</PRE>

in the appropriate directory.

<P>Examples marked (*) are taken from the book ``Le langage Caml'', by
Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy (Dunod, 1993 &amp; 1999). Messages and
identifiers are in French and contain accented letters (ISO 8859-1
encoding). You'll need an 8-bit clean system to read them.<BR>

Examples marked (G) assume installed the portable graphics library
(as found in the <CODE>contrib/libgraph</CODE> directory of the Caml
Light distribution).

<LI>basics:<BR>
        Three all-time favorites: Fibonacci, Eratosthene's sieve, and the
        Unix <CODE>wc</CODE> utility.

<LI>colwheel: (G)<BR>
        The "color wheel" (color space in HSV coordinates).
        Needs at least 256 colors to look good.

<LI>spirals: (G)<BR>
        Explore a family of flashy curves. (Use spir on a color screen
        and spir-bw on a black and white screen.)

<LI>showsort: (G)<BR>
        Graphic animation of sorting algorithms.

<LI>hanoi: (*)<BR>
        Animated towers of Hanoi.

<LI>docteur: (*)<BR>
        A (French-speaking) clone of Eliza.

<LI>calc:<BR>
        This is a simple desk calculator that illustrates the use of camllex 
        and camlyacc.

<LI>camltk: (*) <BR>
        A set of programs to learn using the Caml/Tk graphical user
        interface (GUI). From simple «hello world» program to an
        advanced tetris game. Some examples are from the book ``Le
        langage Caml'', by Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy
        (InterEditions, 1999). See the <A
        HREF="camltk/README">README</A> file in the directory. 

<LI>picomach: (*)<BR>
        An assembler and simulator for a RISC processor.

<LI>grep: (*)<BR>
        Regular expressions and automata.

<LI>compress: (*)<BR>
        File compression and decompression (Huffman).

<LI>demonstr: (*)<BR>
        Tautology checker.

<LI>minicaml: (*)<BR>
        An interpreter and typechecker for a subset of Caml.

<LI>asl:<BR>
        This is the implementation of A Small Language, as described in
        part 3 of ``Functional Programming using Caml Light'', by
        Michel Mauny.

<LI>minilogo: (*) (G)<BR>
        An interpreter for a small language with turtle graphics.

<LI>pascal: (*)<BR>
        An interpreter and compiler for a subset of Pascal.
        The compiler generates code for the <CODE>picomach</CODE> program.

<LI>kb:<BR>
        The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure for rewriting systems.
        Taken from some course notes by Gerard Huet.

<LI>camltk:<BR>
        Examples for the camltk GUI toolkit.

<LI>config:<BR>
        This directory does not contain examples, but configuration
        files used to generate the Makefiles.
