test choice left assoc
	[[a | b | c]] parse to [[(a | b) | c]]

test cons right assoc
	[[a :: b :: c]] parse to [[a :: (b :: c)]]

test constructor binds tighter than cons
	[[a :: b List]] parse to [[a :: (b List)]]

test cons binds tighter than tuple
	[[a :: b, c]] parse to [[(a :: b), c]]

test tuple binds tighter than choice
	[[a, b | c]] parse to [[(a, b) | c]]

test choice binds tighter than alias
	[[a | c as b]] parse to [[(a | c) as b]]
